# Data Structures and Algorithms in Go

These are some basic data structures and algorithms done as practice for interviews and to gain a better understanding
of the Go programming language.

### Structures
- Singly Linked List
- Binary Tree
- Graph
- Hash Table?

### Algorithms
- Breadth-First Search
- Depth-First Search
- Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm
- Others as I see fit


### Tests
All were created using a Test Driven Development approach and so the functioning of each can be determined by
running the test suite.
